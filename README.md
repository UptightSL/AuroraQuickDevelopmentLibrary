# Aurora Quick Development Lib  (AQDL)
## What is AQDL?
AQDL is a development library for Aurora Dashboard :) Note this crappy library was made by a 15 year old. :D
## Docs
I'll make a gitbook if this ever gets large enough (not by people using, by too many stuff added)

```lua
aqdl.getNet(title, buttontext)
```
getNet will send the IP and MAC in a Aurora Textbox :)
```
aqdl.test()
```
test will open and close the dvd tray then send current temps.
## HALTED   
:) This project will be haulted until winter break, I wanna try working on something else.
