# Aurora Quick Development Lib  (AQDL)
## What is AQDL?
AQDL is a development library for Aurora Dashboard :) Note this crappy library was made by a 15 year old. :D
## Docs
I'll make a gitbook if this ever gets large enough (not by people using, by too many stuff added)

```lua
aqdl.getNet(title, buttontext)
```
getNet will send the IP and MAC in a Aurora Textbox :)
```
aqdl.test()
```
test will open and close the dvd tray then send current temps.
# NOTE
Just a quick note, dont expect this at all to be useful to anyone. This is mostly all meant for testing. Feel free to use anything here I won't care.
